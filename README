# Zabbix ServiceNow UI Module

Because it is not desirable in all situations to automatically create (all) problems as a case, this UI module adds an option to the Problem overview. Under the "Close" box is now a "Create Case" option where a case is immediately created and the most relevant data is forwarded to ServiceNow.

## Requirements
Zabbix 5.2
php7
php7-curl
